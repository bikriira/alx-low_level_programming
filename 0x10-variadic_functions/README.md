# Variadic Functions in C

This directory contains examples and explanations of variadic functions in the C programming language.

## Overview

In C programming, a variadic function is a function that can accept a varying number of arguments. This feature allows for greater flexibility when designing functions that need to handle different numbers of inputs.

## Contents

The directory includes the following:

- Examples of variadic functions implemented in C
- Sample code demonstrating the usage and syntax of variadic functions
- Explanations of how variadic functions work and when to use them

## Getting Started

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## Usage

Feel free to use these examples as a reference or starting point for implementing variadic functions in your own C projects. Experiment with the code and modify it to suit your specific requirements.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have any additional examples, improvements, or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## License

This codes are opensource, you are free to add improvements
## Acknowledgments

- The examples and code snippets in this directory are inspired by various resources and online tutorials.
- Thank you to the C programming community for sharing their knowledge and insights on variadic functions.
